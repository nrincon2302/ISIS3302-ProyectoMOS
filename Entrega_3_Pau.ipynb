    "\n",
    "Para el proceso de calibración de parámetros del algoritmo genético aplicado al CVRP, se ha diseñado un plan experimental estructurado basado en un enfoque factorial completo. Este método permite explorar sistemáticamente el espacio de parámetros clave (tamaño de población, tasa de mutación, número de generaciones y tamaño del torneo de selección) evaluando todas sus posibles combinaciones dentro de rangos predefinidos. Para garantizar la robustez estadística de los resultados, cada configuración se ejecutará en tres corridas independientes utilizando diferentes semillas aleatorias (42, 123 y 7890), lo que mitiga el efecto de la estocasticidad inherente a los algoritmos metaheurísticos. Durante la experimentación se registrarán métricas cruciales como el valor de la función objetivo (costo total de las rutas), tiempo de CPU, y estadísticas descriptivas (mejor valor, peor valor, media y desviación estándar) para cada configuración. Este rigor metodológico permitirá identificar la combinación óptima de parámetros que equilibre la calidad de las soluciones con la eficiencia computacional, mejorando así el rendimiento general del algoritmo para los diversos casos de prueba considerados en este estudio."

    "\n",
    "Aunque los algoritmos genéticos (GA) ofrecen claramente la ventaja de rapidez, evidenciamos que el GA completa la búsqueda mucho más rápido que Pyomo bajo cualquier configuración de timeout, su naturaleza heurística implica que no siempre garantizan la factibilidad ni la calidad de la solución, sin un ajuste cuidadoso de hiperparámetros, como tamaño de población, tasas de mutación y cruces, y esquemas de penalización por violaciones de restricciones, el GA puede producir soluciones inviables o subóptimas.\n",
    "\n",
    "En contraste, Pyomo, al apoyarse en solvers matemáticos exactos, asegura factibilidad siempre que exista una solución, y con suficiente tiempo puede converger al óptimo global, además su salida es determinista y reproducible frente a la aleatoriedad inherente del GA, no obstante esa solidez pagada en tiempo de cómputo puede tornarse prohibitiva en problemas de gran escala o con plazos estrictos, donde el GA resulta más práctico, aunque sacrifica garantías de optimalidad, Pyomo requiere modelar explícitamente todas las restricciones y parámetros, lo que puede aumentar la complejidad de implementación, mientras que el GA admite un diseño más flexible de la función objetivo y restricciones implícitas mediante penalizaciones, por último la integración de criterios de robustez y sensibilidad ante cambios en los datos suele ser más directa en el contexto de programación matemática, aunque nuevos esquemas híbridos que combinan GA para exploración rápida con refinamientos locales de Pyomo pueden capturar lo mejor de ambos mundos."
